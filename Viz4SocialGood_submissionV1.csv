This brings social and development problems in the communities. The lack of access to quality public lighting generates insecurity, not only from the criminal point of view, but also from the daily routine. One of the things that is often said about the lack of lighting, both in homes and abroad, is that it ""shortens the day"", relegating daily tasks only to moments of sunlight. We also see poor lighting in houses as a major problem, which generates lack of hygiene and self-development.  Liter of Light Argentina makes quick-install public luminaires not only for specific interventions in neighborhoods, but also to provide lighting in cases of emergencies in which the neighborhood is left without electricity. The solution is based on the installation of luminaires that work with photovoltaic energy with a current of 12v, which are made with cheap and accessible materials throughout the world. These luminaires can be for inside houses, or units of 3 meters high to illuminate an area of up to 40 square meters. The power supply of the system will use lead acid batteries (whose value ranges from US$20 to 50, which will last between 2 and 3 years). It comes with a 30 watt solar panel and can withstand strong winds and 12v outdoor lighting. All these elements can be obtained anywhere in the world, hence the versatility of this system. In turn, these systems, by providing 12v power, can be used to power cell phones, UHF and VHF radios, and other electronics. Thus generating the possibility of communication in case of supply cuts or consequences of natural phenomena. This means that the people of the communities not only learn about the power generation systems, the electrical risk (since these systems replace the clandestine electrical connections that generate fires), and the electrical infrastructure, but also generate in them more strength in knowledge, and communication capacity in case of health emergency.  At the same time, they carry out health, hygiene and sanitation programs since some communities are also far from the health points. These programs help improve the quality of life of people with healthy habits and community nursing actions. T Therefore, this solution gives energy, light, security, adaptation, and technical and health knowledge to the populations.

In terms of heating, the traditional firewood kitchen is highly inefficient and dangerous. Another consequence of the harsh conditions in the region is water scarcity. Due to the lack of superficial sources, community members resort to manual extraction techniques to access underground water. The constant need for water, not only for domestic use but also for the animal herds, makes the physical labor of it even more considerable.

In rural areas women often have their children with them when cooking, so the smoke coming from common earthen stoves affects both the mothers and the children.Around 90 percent families in Bangladesh are using ordinary stoves for cooking. The smoke produced from such large number of common stoves lead to 50 thousand premature deaths every year and 2.5 million cases of people suffering from asthma.

Propensity score matching, a quasi-experiment econometric method, was applied using the 2018 household survey data of the BIDS that collected information from 600 users of Bondhu Chula and 396 users of traditional cook stoves. It was found that about 90 per cent of the study households depend on fuelwood for their energy need for cooking, whether they use Bondhu Chula or not. Other fuels used by both groups of households included tree leaves, hay or jute cake, dung and wooden powder. Except for cow dung, the energy consumption was much less among households using Bondhu Chula compared to the households using traditional cook stoves. This indicates the efficiency of Bondhu Chula in terms of fuel need. The efficiency of Bondhu Chula in fuel use was also observed by comparing the energy use of households before and after the installation of Bondhu Chula. The pertinent statistics showed that energy use significantly dropped after the installation of Bondhu Chula. This was observed for all types of fuel used by Bondhu Chula users. From these results, one can conclude that the use of Bondhu Chula significantly lowers biomass energy consumption. One can also infer that this reduction of energy use significantly reduces air pollution and deforestation because 91 per cent of the sampled households used fuelwood for the purpose of cooking and the sources of fuelwood were mainly trees. The results of the econometric exercise show that the impact of Bondhu Chula use on household biomass energy is significant. It was found that the use of Bondhu Chula reduces the per capita biomass fuel consumption on average, with a range of 9.75 kg to 12.25 kg per month. In terms of percentage reduction, this is about 30-37 per cent compared to the amount of biomass fuel used by traditional cook stoves. The laboratory test, as conducted in Bangladesh by the BCSIR, claims that Bondhu Chula saves 50 per cent fuel compared to traditional cook stoves. The difference between claimed fuel reduction and empirically obtained reduction is perhaps due to varying cooking habits practised by the surveyed households. Based on the above findings, the average level of savings in biomass fuel consumption due to the use of Bondhu Chula to be about 11 kg per household member per month, which is about 600 kg per household per year. With more than 29 million households, Bangladesh has a great market potential for Bondhu Chula. With 67 per cent of households using more than one stove, this could increase the total number of stoves to more than 50 million. Taking this potential market into account, the potential fuelwood consumption saving is about 30 million tonnes per year, which is about 51 per cent of the country's total fuelwood consumption. When converting this biomass fuel-saving into the potential reduction of carbon dioxide emission, we obtain that the use of Bondhu Chula would potentially reduce 50.49 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission per year nationally.

Individually the solutions can provide e.g. a cleaner cooking atmosphere, light or better gardening amongst others. Together they can fulfill basic needs and provide energy and resources for increased income generation. Furthermore, with the focus on local solutions EVD does not generate dependency on central supplies of e.g. electricity and fossil fuels where the supply is too often erratic and costly. EVD is more than a collection of sustainable solutions, as it includes installation of the right solutions for each area and village, according to the climate, livelihood and needs. In addition, it includes the integration of solutions and stepwise development, where the villagers gradually attain the solutions, as they are able to afford them and organize themselves to use them effectively. The solutions are not just technologies; they also include the training and support for permanent use and maintenance, as well as other frameworks such as funding mechanisms in order to have a long-term progression of living standards in a sustainable way.

Each of the villages has unique features in relation to usage of renewable energy technologies, demonstrating access to environmentally friendly energy as well as attaining a better standard of living. In off-grid villages like Khowamuri and Sudhkhira, the focus is on using solar home systems to provide electric power. People are also considering biogas plants and if a community-based biogas plant can be adopted. The village Ashulia is highly focused on biogas-based energy. There are several households in the village that raise cattle and poultry. Owners of the cattle farm sell milk in a nearby market, whereas owners of the poultry farm sell their chickens in large city. Cow-dung from the cattle farm and poultry litter from the poultry farm are used to produce biogas to be used for households as well as for cooking on the farms. The next step is to popularize the usage of bio-slurry as fertilizer. Comprehensive approaches to slurry usage as well as electricity generation from excess gas have been suggested in village discussions. Grameen Shakti has brought agriculture and biogas experts to the village to inform residents about better usage of slurry in the agricultural field and about quality of the slurry as organic fertilizer. Experts are considering introducing solar-based dryers to dehydrate slurry in an effort to obtain a higher, standardized nutrient content. Apart from the Solar Home Systems, Biogas Plants and Improved Cook Stoves the following village EVD solutions have been installed: Solar street light in off-grid Khowamuri village: 4 Solar street lights (20 Wp each) have been set up in the off-grid village Khowamuri for better movement and security. Meanwhile, the Government of Bangladesh has also taken a project to set up solar street light and Solar Home system in the village area under the project Food for Work and Test Relief. So, EVD solution is in lined with the country's development strategies. Solar pump for clean drinking water and lighting in a primary school at Shudhkhira (Bokchor) village A Solar Water Pump for clean drinking water for a school in the village has been installed as it was well known that iron content is very high in the drinking water. Also a Solar System was installed and will run a 1 HP water pump and provide electricity (250 Watt) to the light and the fans in the class rooms. Bamboo cage for slurry-pit of biogas plant in Ashulia (Dermran) village: In the biogas village, the lack of slurry management is very common which is why a bamboo cage for open slurry pit has been adopted. The EVD intervention in Bangladesh has given the opportunity to bring integrated comprehensive sustainable village development to off-grid areas of Bangladesh. EVD model has given the villagers the opportunity to be integrated in the village development which is really a crucial issue in South Asia.",https://ecovillagedevelopment.net/bangladesh/,,,,,,x,x,,,,,,,7.0,11.0,13.0,15.0,,reneweable energy,biogas,nature-based solutions,sustainable energy,waste management,23.778261,90.379521,file: img-427,,,,,,,,,Bangladesh,rb_asia_pacific,,product

This also ensures bio-security and proper litter management in these farms. Moreover, slurry produced in the digesters as byproduct is a good bio-fertilizer.According to the Livestock Department, currently there are more than 150,000 poultry farms in Bangladesh with about 1,500 farms having more than 20,000 birds population. So, Bangladesh has good potential for biogas based electricity projects.

Biogas plants not only provide gas for cooking purpose but also produce organic fertilizer for the crops and fish pond. The program helps reduce the use of biomass fuel for cooking. Till December 2021, IDCOL has financed construction of over 61,200 biogas plants all over the country through its 37 partner organizations. IDCOL finances plants with daily gas production capacity ranging from 1.2 m3 to 25.0 m3 thereby meeting demand of both domestic households and mid-sized dairy and poultry farms. IDCOL currently finances two models of biogas plants: brick-cement based plants and pre-fabricated bio-digester based plants. The program saves 58,750 tons of firewood ever year worth USD 4.6 million and also reduces the use of 52,000 tons of chemical fertilizer worth USD 13.6 million by producing 363,000 tons of organic fertilizer. The program also reduces 234,000 ton CO2 consumption per annum.

These water sources are diminishing rapidly, primarily due to deforestation. As a result, the communities are increasingly facing water shortages ever year especially during the dry season. The women and children are the worst sufferers as they are assigned to collect water for their families. They have to travel far from their village to fetch water, and in some areas, they spend almost half a day in search for water. Time spent collecting water means less time for work and education for the adults and the children. To tackle this issue, the UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab, in collaboration with local grassroots organization Creative Conservation Alliance, is deploying a solution - HYDRAM or hydraulic ramp pump system - in a remote village of CHT to generate learning on whether the model works. Hydram is a relatively low cost, low-maintenance water pumping system capable of lifting water up to 600 vertical feet from the water source to the village up the hill. This pump uses the natural power of water flowing downhill to lift the water and doesn't require any external energy sources or electricity to operate, and hence is environmentally sustainable.

Yet, many of these remote communities now find themselves on the frontlines of the expanding extractive frontier, as seismic testing for oil wells and pipeline projects move deeper and deeper into the jungle. To access to nonexistent electricity services, solar system developed by ""Love for Life"", have been implemented in 16 remote communities. The photovoltaic (PV) cells of the solar panels absorb sunlight and convert the energy from the sun into direct current (DC) electricity to charge the batteries. This DC electricity is fed to the batteries via a solar charge controller which ensures the batteries are charged most efficiently and not damaged. The charge controller constantly controls and manages the energy flow in the solar electric system. It regulates the state of charge of the batteries and the intensity of the charge. It protects the batteries from overcharge and deep discharge. DC appliances like 12 V LED-lights, cellphone or radio are powered directly from the charge controller which during daylight takes the energy directly from the PV panels and at night from the stored energy in the batteries. The inverter converts lower voltage DC electricity (12V) generated by the solar panels and stored in the batteries into higher voltage alternating current (AC) to power appliances that run with 120 V like electrical power tools, computer, television, etc. The big solar system has an additional device called battery protect that protects the battery from deep discharge, ensuring the longevity of the batteries. It works as a switch that turns off all the loads. The battery protect also communicates with the battery monitor and performs the function according to the information of the battery monitor. The battery monitor works together with a measurement device called Shunt that collects and transmits all the data about the system and sends it to the battery monitor.

To solve that gap, Tagaddod built Green Pan, an app that allows households to schedule UCO pickups and another one for hotels, restaurants and cafes or Horecas for short. The company then exports the UCO to refineries abroad, where it turns into biofuel and hydrogenated vegetable oil basically the new version of biofuel, from which other types of fuel (jet fuel, diesel, gasoline etc.) can be extracted.

As a result, more trees are being cut down leading to erosion the destruction of habitats for wild animals. For the Mbuluzi Game Reserve, like most rural communities, access to modern energy services such as electricity especially for water heating purposes, remains a challenge as modern energy services such as electricity and gas are very expensive, yet the need to sustainably use forest resources remains a high priority. This solution was designed to meet this need while ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources.

The solution was developed by the Mbuluzi Game Reserve  working with a local artisan (welder) to provide an energy-efficient, affordable off- normally heated more water than required and needed more fuel wood. This solution provided a more sustainable option which was affordable and easy to make with basic artisan skills. It adapted existing technologies to produce a solution that fits the needs of the Game Reserve, but that could easily serve the needs of households.

Mbuluzi Game Reserve is based in the Lubombo region of Eswatini, and its main aim is to conserve the country's biodiversity. One of the tourism services offered by the facility in addition to accommodation is a camping facility. Initially, the camp site used a large wood-powered boiler system to heat water for its campers. However, this system proved inefficient and time-consuming as it required a lot of wood even if there were only two campers in the facility. This created the need for a more efficient off-grid system. This solution therefore aims to minimise the use of fuel wood resources to conserve the country's bio-biodiversity. The water heating system can be made with scrap materials and requires minimum technical skills and can be easily made by local welders.

The main objectives of the water heater solution are:

- Provision of an affordable (uses scrap material), energy efficient (uses less than a third of the firewood that was used for the old system), easy to make and maintain (has no moving parts), and timesaving (heats water faster) water heating system

- Provision of opportunities for upcycling scrap metal (from near-by mills),

- Reduced negative impact on natural biodiversity (particularly the flora or forest), and

Reducing the risk of forest fires through a nearly enclosed system.

The water heating system is made up of discarded scrap metals from the nearby sugar factory. The system was designed and fabricated by the Game Ranger and a local retired welder. The structure constitutes of a concrete small shelter to protect the fire word from rain, a small oven-like fire box, a water cylinder, cold water inlet and hot water (shower) outlet. The structure is also fitted with a safety valve to release excess heat/ pressure should it get too hot, as a safety measure.

The system can be used for multiple purposes, e.g., cooking and heating, and possibly baking as it has the properties of an oven, making it easier for campers to prepare food.

What has made it successful is its low cost, use of reclaimed materials, ease of development and opportunity to provide a livelihood. The artisan who fabricates it is now able to make a living out of it.

Sun Oct 11 2020 14:51:45 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Sun Oct 11 2020 14:51:45,1784,Non-renewable,,Informal and DIY gas stations in remote locations - Aisha,AccLab Indonesia,Contributor 161,"Throughout my daily route, I have come to notice the proliferate existence of small scale gas stations, or 'Pertamini' as they are called here in Indonesia, as a word play from the national energy company's name, Pertamina. These mini gas stations initially started as a collective initiative from various communities throughout Indonesia, utilizing jerry cans or reused bottles (such as those from alcoholic drinks), and are stacked in a wire rack by the side of the road, typically in remote locations. As the years go by, more modern products are developed and sold in the market, entitled 'Pertamini' or mini 'Pertamina' boxes, mimicking the large scale gas stations with their tubular storage, digital display and hose. As seen in the photos enclosed, currently there is a wide array of models available for purchase and usage, displayed in smaller roads. The main target market for these informal gas stations are mostly motorcycle riders, which travels covers to the utmost remote locations of Indonesia.

The sporadic initiative of utilizing jerry cans or used bottles in the early establishments of these small scale gas stations stemmed from the unmet need of fuel coverage for remote locations in Indonesia. As the biggest archipelago in the world, Indonesia is riddled with issues of increasing inequality, not limited to that of infrastructure and development. Thus, despite the unprecedented rate of urbanization, majority of its population still travels to remote locations to fulfill their daily necessities utilizing cars, motorcycles, and other types of vehicles. As the national energy company, Pertamina, only focuses on constructing large scale gas stations in various cities, it is challenging to cover rural areas with limited access and infrastructure. In order to further support daily activities of its population, several creative entrepreneurs started to purchase gas in jerry cans in order to include in their shops' range of products. They then gain profit from increasing the price slightly compared to that of the large gas stations and reaching the outskirts of cities. 

What started out as a seemingly scattered initiative to increase microentrepreneurs' profit, has turned into a collective movement that evolves in an accelerated pace. From employing available materials in the neighborhood, with the healthy competition among other business owners and growing need from the informal market, this particular innovation has even instigated 'proper' the importance of product design as a means to reach customers. This model has proven to be successful with the vast replication throughout Indonesia, with more developing advanced versions of the 'Pertamini' gas station. By accommodating basic mobility needs for majority of the population, this grassroot innovation has supported developments in different areas such as providing access to accessible transport systems, contributing to road safety, enabling access to school and healthcare, among others. If other communal pain points that span over the entire country's population can be identified and adeptly tackled, then the replication process could potentially occur naturally and its impact could be as in-depth as in this case study.

The rapid rate of urbanization throughout the world has led to the generation of increasing amounts of waste, including plastic waste and this in turn poses difficulties for disposal. The problem is more acute in developing countries such as Kenya. The ban on plastic bags/carriers took effect on 28th August 2017 which is a positive move towards reducing plastic waste. A more constraining issue arises on how to dispose off the current waste. Megagas focuses on the manufacturing of clean cooking gaseous fuel from various polymeric compounds, commonly known as plastic waste. This waste is found easily and cheaply thus making the product affordable and sustainable. James Isedia Mulema the founder of Megagas stumbled on the idea of manufacturing clean cooking fuel during trials to use plastic waste to harvest storm water. In 2014 he harvested his first gas into a makeshift cylinder he had made. Through this innovation, he has provided jobs for the youth by hiring them to collect the plastic waste, the raw material that he uses to produce the gas.

As there is no centralized infrastructure, each family decides on how to heat their house. Because of the high electricity cost, most people  use coal for this purpose which is the  determinant of extremely bad air quality in Bishkek.  In one of the houses I saw an interesting  furnace which is the core of the heating system of the house. It was made by the owner of the house. As he said, they bought this house just a year ago and last year he was notifying that they spent too much on coal, moreover it took a lot of efforts  for him and his family members to look after the furnace and add coal every 40-45 minutes to maintain certain temperature. Moreover, they also had to pick all the ash with their hands, otherwise the furnace might become clogged very shortly. 


So, with his engineer background, he created a new furnace where you can open the top, put coals in three buckets from which the needed amount of coal automatically goes to the fire; it is enough for 12-14 hours, meaning you need to put coal only twice a day, not every 40 minutes. It is very efficient for maintaining the temperature, as if you miss your time to put coal in the traditional furnace, the home temperature goes lower immediately and you need to spend more coal to warm up the system - > more air pollution & more expenses.  Furthermore the ash is also collected in a separate part of the furnace, which they further use as natural fertilizer.


Recently he installed thermostat into the system - so it is already a semiautomated heating system. The inventor also mentioned, that all his neighbors are interested in this approach and ask him either explain the technology or ready to pay him for his help. Thus, he has become a positive deviant in the village (what he does not know yet =) ). Unfortunately, I was not able to take photos of the internal parts as the furnace was on the working mode.

Walking by rows of trading places, I was thinking if I can find something which is worth the grassroot innovation name. It was a last row and I said myself ""Where I should go next to find the innovations?"", and immediately I faced with farmer selling his vegetables in interesting boxes. Bingo! I greeted him ""Salam aleykum!"" and he answered ""Waleykum assalam!"". 
After traditional greetings I asked his permission to interview him and make some photos. Bakhadyr baike (brother in Kyrgyz language) told his story. His name is Bakhadyr and he lives in Sretenka village in 45 kilometers from Bishkek city. Twenty years ago Bakhadyr with his wife decided to immigrate from the South of Kyrgyzstan to neighborhood of Bishkek for 'better live'. Now they have a daughter and a son. His family has a small land (plant is 50 ares) where they grow potatoes, bell pepper, pumpkin and other vegetables. 
Bakhadyr told that last three weeks were very cold in Bishkek (up to minus 12 degrees!), so it was hard to keep vegetables (especially, perishable ones) in good condition. Many traders in the streets challenged with high risk to lose their goods and save the only source of income. Bakhadyr was thinking how to sustain his 'green' worth. One day he decided to construct 'thermos' for keeping temperature warmer than outside. He drawn a design of box, took 2 insulation lists (left after repair works) and scotch tape. After several manipulations two new and promising boxes were ready to use.

Testing was very successful, and it is amazing that fresh bell pumpkins stay 'tradable'. In order to increase temperature in thermo-box, from time to time Bakhadyr lights a candle inside.
By the way, Bakhadyr said that he has another grassroot innovations in his household, and I hope that I will have a chance to discover new innovations and share new stories how ordinary people solve daily challenges.

Alimentation :  un ventilateur de 13 W est alimente par une  batterie solaire de 12V, d'une capacite de 200 Ah. La batterie est alimentee par un panneau solaire de 250 W. Un convertisseur de 500 W assure la conversion du courant continu de la batterie en courant alternatif.

He said that the secret lies in their piling of the ice. Unlike the practice in the Ice plants and other Storage Facilities, the block are piled vertically upright position, they do it in a horizontal position. Moreover, they pile the blocks side by side, eliminating the space in between them. This prevents air to get in between which speeds up the melting of ice. Considering that the facility is purely constructed from concrete, they cover the ice with layers of plastic bags which also aid in slowing the melting of ice.

This makes Opaw Ice 4 Sale one standout in innovation.

The need to extend shelf / storage life of ice blocks.

For ice retailers who are looking to extend ice blocks shelf life.

A. The staff of this ice storage facility are unconscious that they have been applying principles of thermodynamics. This is evidence by their unique way of piling ht e blocks of ice inside the storage room. Unlike the usual practice where the blocks are positioned vertically upright- they pile the ice horizontally. This is done to keep the ice from getting too much exposure from the heat on the room's ceiling. Since the facility is made up of full concrete, the walls and ceilings absorb the sun's energy , hence the nearer the ice is to the ceiling the faster it melts.

B. The usual practice of piling them often creates gaps and spaces in between the blocks. With their innovation, they pile the ice side by side, closely to each other, thereby eliminating the spaces. This keeps air from getting out in between the spaces which speeds up the melting process.

C. Since the facility is made up of full concrete, heat is absorbed and the inside is basically, warm, hot or humid. So, to delay the melting process of ice, they cover the pile with layers of thick plastic bags so as to reduce the penetration of heat. This also more sanitary than the use of rice hulls which was an old practice of delaying the melting of ice.

Low-cost agriculture. 
The farm is just about 180 square feet but produces 200 heads of lettuce and consists of a series of wall pipes, a coy aquarium and rows of custom-made full spectrum China-made, LED grow lights. The single room is air-conditioned and has an air purifier and to the extreme right of the room, on the far end from the entrance, there is a tall blue barrel where the water from the aquarium is purified as well (he has never had to change or replace water since first putting water in May, 2020); the purified water is fed to the plants which are seen at different stages of growth, protruding from the holes in the PVC pipes. The main product of the farm at present is variety of lettuce, which he describes as a douglar a Trinidadian term for a mix, because it is a cross between the US buttercrunch and a more popular local variety. For lettuces, the main product of the farm, the cycle from seed to harvest is 35 days and is estimated to have at least 18 crop cycles. Ronnie believes he can replicate that cycle for strawberries, compared to conventionally grown California strawberries where the seed-to harvest period lasts 49 to 62-days and where there are just 3 crop cycles per year. 
The secret to the farm is the exact mix of fertiliser, which comprises treated fish faeces, sea minerals and recycled water and the carefully calibrated lighting. Each plant, he explains, requires special lighting for it to absorb the right amount of minerals and for it to grow a particular way. Prior to acquiring custom-made Chinese lights, the lettuce was limp, the way they are preferred in China.Experimenting with other lights, the lettuce was too firm and tough. Ronnie also has mature lettuce plants where he can get his seeds for new germination. Through his own research, he specified the kind of lighting he wants for his own lettuce, suitable for the Trinidad and Tobago customer. In one section of the farm, he is growing strawberries (there are a few young ones on the shrub), dwarf apple trees and kiwis.

The People Behind the ""Farm""
Ronnie Yearwood and his wife are Trinidadian Christian missionaries based in Guinea Bissau for 28 years. They started growing pigeon peas to make Trinidadian pelau, a signature dish from Trinidad. In Guinea Bissau's fertile soils the crop flourished, to the extent that what should have been a pigeon peas shrub quickly became a pigeon peas tree. Having access to 10 acres of land in Cumuto, Trinidad, Ronnie decided to use two acres for pimento pepper cultivation, hoping to replicate his Guinea Bissau experience. But Ronnie soon discovered, that the Caribbean is not Africa. The work was arduous and labour intensive, the temperatures were often too high making irrigation pipes a necessity, soils were plagued with root-eating nematodes, and insects proved too many to beat. Yields were small both in terms of the amount given and the size of the produce. To make matters worse, Ronnie took loan from the Agricultural Development Bank for the project. While the authorities and agriculture shops recommended pesticides, Ronnie, a chemist by training,  preferred to avoid the use of commercial pesticides, apart from the standard combinations of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus (NPK) formulae. Having seen the ease of cultivation in Guinea Bissau, and the success of large-scale controlled agriculture in California, USA, Ronnie decided to study how to produce crops in a clean, pest- and pesticide-free environment, with low water and energy reliance but on a small scale. Today that project has become Beyond Organic ‚Äì a small commercial farm operating out of the annex of Ronnie and Beverley's Trinidad and Tobago home in East Trinidad. Ronnie Yearwood and Beverley, his wife, still live in Guinea Bissau but they travel home for a few months from time to time. One such visit, in October, 2019, unexpectedly extended for personal reasons and then on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, has become a year-long stay and the start of Beyond Organic, operational since May 2020.

The entire cost of the annex, inclusive of construction, temperature regulation and irrigation, was TT$60,000. The most notable recurrent costs, according to Ronnie, is the cotton-wool cosmetic pads that he uses for germinating the seeds, costing TT$10.00 for 100 pads. Ronnie looks back and compares the new farm with the cost of the failed 2 acre project two years ago, where he would have had a loan of TT$200,000, plus extensive manual labour. If he hadn't used inherited family land, it would have been even more expensive.

Improving the model
The Beyond Organic model has the potential to produce clean agriculture at a fraction of the cost of conventional agriculture. But Ronnie sees ways to further reduce the cost of his operation. For instance, since he is stuck here in Trinidad and Tobago, he's plugged into the electric grid. However, he had originally wanted to use solar power. In Trinidad and Tobago, a net producer of fossil-fuel energy, commercial rates are too low to make solar generation practical. For poorer countries where energy is more expensive, he envisages solar powered fans and cooling systems. I asked him about something like a staple carbohydrate, like the hardy dry-land rice currently branded Moruga Hill rice, in Trinidad and Tobago. After all, starving
people don't want lettuce and strawberries. This method can be used to grow anything. You just have to do the research and experiment, he explains. Some crops just need more space, he further elucidated, indicating that apples will need to be about 6-7 feet apart.

Ronnie's Dream
Ronnie wants to experiment with a wider range of crops, especially those that address the cultural needs of people in West Africa. His particular dream is to continue working on the project in West Africa, which is where his heart is. He explains that this model is not for use everywhere in Africa, or everywhere in West Africa. In some parts of West Africa there are drought conditions from October to July. If they can capture just a little bit of that water and use it effectively, they can have food all year. One tilapia can spawn more than 10,000 fingerlings, meaning that there is a lot of fertiliser for the crops. He wants missionaries like himself to learn the model and use it to grow what the people want and need. Nevertheless, while Ronnie eyes his adopted home, Guinea Bissau, he sees the usefulness of his model for small-island countries like his native Trinidad and Tobago, where there is a high food import bill. His model, he asserts, can reduce the high food import bill of many small-island developing countries. 

Another area of focus that concerns Ronnie is light-engineered plants. Since light affects the plants' uptake of nutrients, Ronnie envisages the engineering of crops using diffident intensities of light during
their growth phase, to adjust the level of particular vitamins and minerals that they contain. For example low-potassium lettuce would be suitable for consumption by dialysis patients. Confident that he already knows how to do it, Ronnie is currently looking for a laboratory where he can get the biological components of his produce tested.

Neither of these burns and vaporising the moisture wastes energy. LPG, by contrast, is all fuel. Per unit of delivered cooking heat, burning wood generates about five times the carbon of LPG. Switching from wood to LPG reduces cooking's carbon emissions significantly. In Uganda, where much traditional cooking happens, switching from wood fuel to LPG cuts net-CO2 output to the atmosphere by 60%.
Switching 100 households from consuming 200 tonnes of harvested wood a year to consume instead 21.5 tonnes of LPG would save one hectare of forest each year.

His family had a conventional hamam, or water-heater, which used wood as fuel. Watching smoke escape from the burning wood made him aware of heat wastage. His innovation came out of his experiments on the hamam to use this heat efficiently. He named the innovation after his son Raman Deep as Ramandeep Eco Hamam. The phrase Eco is used as the device is fuel efficient and produced less smoke. Conventional hamams get damaged very soon and a lot of energy gets wasted as well. Every year or two, either a new one has to be purchased or the top portion needs to be replaced. To address this problem, he modified the hamam by removing the top portion and using aluminum sheet instead of iron sheet. One day when hamam was being used, he forgot to remove a four litre water container he kept on its top. After half an hour while draining out hot water, he realised that he had got additional four litres of hot water without extra effort or cost. This triggered him to utilize the heat otherwise going waste. In his attempt, he removed the aluminum cover and placed a ten litre container of water directly on the top of hamam. But instead of heating the water, the fire got extinguished as the air flow got blocked. The hamam had to be lit again. A metal ring was kept on the hamam and sides were punched to ensure better air flow. But for refueling, still, the container on the top had to be removed, which was cumbersome. A window was then cut for refueling but that led to the escape of flames to the outside and loss of heat. Then instead of the window, a door was used, but then complete combustion was not taking place and a lot of smoke was being generated. He kept on addressing one issue after the other and modifying the hamam till he was satisfied with the output. The Raman Deep Eco Hamam (Water heater) The modified hamam consists of a conventional hamam and two heat exchangers. Water is filled in the tank through the inlet and wood is ignited. Similar to the conventional hamam, water is directly heated in the lower most chambers. The heat exchangers channelise heat generated through smoke and flames to further heat the water. Valves are present to allow water to pass from one chamber to another. When the water in the lower most chamber attains a temperature close to 100 degrees Celsius, it can be drained out separately. On being emptied, the lower chamber can be refilled with water from other chambers. As this water is preheated, it takes less time and fuel to reach 100 degrees Celsius. Alternatively, once water in the lower chamber reaches 100 degrees Celsius, it can be mixed so the overall temperature becomes around 55 degrees Celsius. The water from other chambers can also be separately drained out through separate outlets. Better fuel utilization reduces the money and/or labour involved in obtaining fuel wood. The hamam has been tested at CTAE, Udaipurm which has found its thermal efficiency to be 58% against 38.5% of conventional hamam. The CO/CO2 ratio was found 0.035 in modified hamam and 0.038 in conventional hamam which are within the safe limits. The concept of utilizing heat of smoke by using heat exchangers in the path of smoke or flumes is known in art (US Patent 4377200, 4397297, 4628869, 4137965, etc) however, the same is not available for domestic stoves. Accordingly, NIF filed a patent in the innovator's name (1743/DEL/2011). He is awaiting the grant of the patent to start commercialization of the hamam.

Given the limited global supply of fossil fuels, the search for renewable energy has been on the top of the sustainability agenda. Biomass gasification, a century-old technology, is viewed today as an alternative to conventional fuel. In the gasification process, wood, charcoal, and other biomass materials are gasified to produce so-called producer gas for power or electricity generation. Mr. Rai Singh Dahiya observed that the users of biomass gas (producer gas) as a fuel generally complain about choking in the engine after running for a certain period. He solved this problem. The innovator has changed the conventional design of gasifiers, especially the filters and cooling units to get clean gas and ensure smooth operation of the engine at low operational cost. It is a downdraft type bio- mass gasifier, a compact and efficient system for converting BioMass into producer gas which is used as a fuel in running Diesel Engine by making little modification to the engine. The Biomass is burnt in a furnace packed from all the sides and has one outlet to pass the gases to another chamber where these gases are cooled and then passed through the filter for filtration. This filtered gas is then fed to the engine, as a substitute for diesel or like other fuel, for its running. 1. Compact, mobile, and a soundproof unit 2. Extremely clean gas generated from the gasifier, making downstream cleaning systems simple. 3. It converts the agricultural waste into the generation of the electrical power 4. No need for continuous flow of water, easy to operate, no extra training or skill is required 5. Reliable & rugged system, stand-alone mobile system, can be used anywhere where we need power. 6. All types of wood waste and fuelwood Stalks of cotton, pulses, coconut shells, coconut palm stalks, Maize cobs, Rice husk, Branches & twinges, briquettes of various agricultural residues, Certain Industrial wastes of paper mills, plywood industry, etc can be used as a fuel. 7.

These features of this generator have made it capable of delivering constant output and the capacity to work on low cutting speed, as against other similar devices1 .The AC power generator runs on the principle of mutual inductance. Any prime mover, such as wind power or hydraulic turbine or any source, from which rotary motion is available, can drive it.The highlight of this innovation is the ability to use centrifugal force, generated in the main power shaft with the use of governor, to vary the gap between stator and rotor elements. This allows very low cutting (wind) speeds to start the generator by increasing the air gap at start up. The governor facilitates reduction of this gap at higher speeds. Since the generator output is available from the stator, which is fixed, this does not require brush or slip ring.The shaft rotates and the centrifugal action helps in varying the gap between stator and rotor elements. When the rotor shaft gains momentum and the speed is increased, the centrifugal weights of the governor fly outwards actuating two levers and bring both the pairs of stator and rotor together with minimum air gap.Using commonly available materials, the innovator has built first functional prototype for Rs 7000 and more work is underway to test and standardize the product.Nirma Institute of Technology, Ahmedabad has also tested this machine. It has been submitted by NIF and GIAN West to TePP as a project proposal for funding and development.This product once fully developed will aid introduction of wind operated energy devices in areas with low wind speeds and will provide a green sustainable energy generation solution.

He worked on the basis that the conventional turbines have just 50% efficiency because of the uselessness of the upper blades, which have no mechanical output as it is a half-immersion version. Therefore he tried a full immersion turbine in which the blades were of half the area. But the mechanical output was found to be approximate twice the first version. Then he utilized this turbine in his generator cum pump driven by the river Kulashi with full submersion. At first, he made the turbine with a bamboo frame and later he strengthened it with an iron one. He also increased the number of blades from eight to twelve. Kalita acknowledges that at first, his family was not very interested in the idea, but later on, encouraged him. He is proud to note that his neighbors also benefited from his innovation. He confides that making this turbine successfully has been a satisfying experience. Furthermore, the connection with his innovative side has motivated him to pursue further ideas and he mentions that he is considering the development of an energy-related device. Remembering with gratitude the assistance offered by Mr. Diganta Kalita - who introduced him to GIAN- NE - he calls him his best friend in his journey of innovation. Kalita has designed two variants of turbine and pump models. Initially, he had developed a water turbine using bamboo for harnessing the flow energy from the river to pump water to his land way back in 1998-99. And later with assistance from GIAN-NE, a voluntary organization working in the field of development of grass-root innovations, he developed another version of the same turbine. First model The first model had a spiral offset arrangement of blades. In this, the blade axis is perpendicular to the flow direction. The offset arrangement of blades provides constant thrust to the system. In conventional water wheels, thrust is available only once when the blade is perpendicular to the flow direction. In the present arrangement, it is similar to the multi-cylinder crank arrangement in which the turbine will get thrust constantly from blades. The offset arrangement also provides sufficient clearance between blades so that floating debris will not clog the blades. Since the path of the water takes a spiral shape from the entrance to the exit, the arrangement of blades acts as a screw conveyor. This facilitates the debris to pass on from the entrance to the exit, which facilitates the smooth running of the turbine. The arrangement of the baffle-operated pump, which acts as a submersible pump facilitates the lifting of water. The cost of the complete system is only about Rs.3, 000 including labor costs which are quite affordable by small farmers. Second model The second one is an improved model in comparison with his first innovation. In this, blades are arranged spirally and the axis of the turbine is parallel to the flow direction. This arrangement is superior in construction and operation. The spiral twist of the blades in addition to tapping energy from the water provides vortex motion to the water at the exit. This feature is found to be novel as the kinetic energy of the water absorbed by the blades is regained by water due to vortex motion. (By creating a vortex in the direction of the flow, resistance will decrease i.e. water velocity will increase). In most of the existing turbines, turbulence created by the wheel rotation affects the velocity considerably. This parameter is of importance when considering the performance of downstream turbines. Working principle The turbine is completely submerged below the flow of water (river). The linear kinetic energy of the water is used for giving rotation movement to the turbine. The water passing through the turbine forces the turbine to rotate at low speed but with high torque. When the linear kinetic velocity of the water is two-meter per minute the turbine starts to rotate with a speed of 20 r.p.m. A compound gear mechanism is used to convert the rotational speed of the turbine (20 r.p.m) to a considerable requirement. An armature coil (generator) is used to extract electrical energy. A submersible pump is also coupled to the turbine set for irrigation purposes. The rotational speed of the turbine is given with the help of the driven gear and a flat belt. The turbine is made up of steel foils with a rim where the blades are welded. A-frame is made to hold the turbine in running condition when the turbine is submerged in the water. A compound gear mechanism is used to increase the speed of the armature coil shaft. The generating set (turbine) consists of the following parts namely twelve turbine Blades (flat type), a supporting frame/ trust, a drive gear with 10 teeth and a driven gear with 140 teeth, a Pulley, a Connecting belt (Flat type), an Armature coil and a Chain belt. The blades are welded in a four feet circular rim at an angle of 35¬∞. The upper parts of the 12 blades are fixed in the circular rim that is four inches in width and the lower part of the turbine is fixed in an axle. A chain is fitted to the turbine axle and the drive gear. A lever mechanism is used to control the generation of the power by disengaging the driven gear where the shaft is coupled. A pump with a guide blade is used for irrigation. The driven gear with the help of a flat belt gives the required rotation of the pump for pumping water. Advantages The novelty lies in its portability and the fact that there is no need for a dam. Economically it is a better bet as construction and installation cost is minimal at Rs.8000, as compared to hydroelectric, steam, or any other power plant where even a micro hydel generator costs at least Rs.40,000. The maintenance cost is also quite low compared to the conventional hydroelectric power plant. Its efficiency is greater than 50%. It can be set up anywhere be it plains or mountains. And of the greatest importance is the fact that the turbine has a very high potential in rural areas where electric power supply is not available.

A stove repairing mechanic, he earns his livelihood mainly through the business of manufacturing furnace stoves. He earns Rs. 36000 per annum. He also has a keen interest in painting. Genesis He got the inspiration for developing the innovation by observing the kerosene lantern, which is widely used in villages. He faced a lot of difficulties in procuring the raw materials for developing the innovation and arranging finances. Niranjan Prasad admits that in his pursuit of developing this stove, he was neither helped by his family nor anyone else. It was his own strong determination that kept him going. At the same time, he remembers with gratitude the help given by the Bank Manager of Bank of Baroda, Pilibhit. Niranjan is quite interested in starting a business of his own with this innovation for which he expects the initial investment to be around two lakhs rupees. This stove is based on the principle of kerosene atomization. The key concept is that of pre-heating the kerosene flowing in from the cylinder thereby converting it into gaseous form. It is then fed into the burner to give a clear blue flame without any smoke, sound or deposition of carbonaceous soot on the cooking vessel. The heating is achieved through a delivery pipe fitted above the flame. NIF in coordination with the GIANs has sanctioned an amount of Rs. 37, 250 from its Micro Venture Incubation Fund for prototype development for market research for the improved kerosene stove and three other innovations. Advantages This innovation enables higher combustion of kerosene. It consumes 25% less kerosene and burns with a blue flame thus eliminating smoke. In addition as no soot deposits on the bottom of the cooking vessel it removes the drudgery of cleaning the soot filled cooking vessels. Scientific bent of mind‚Ä¶ From his early childhood, Niranjan had a keen interest towards science. His foray into innovations included tinkering with several useful devices such as kerosene gas burner, dosa maker, diesel burner as well as small machinery like combustion engines, valves, pistons etc. This kerosene gas burner consumes 200 ml oil per hour. It is less noisy and due to the presence of rotating burners, there is less accumulation of carbon. The dosa burner's plate is made of copper and has eight pores in it. It shows less deposition of carbon and burns with a blue flame. The diesel burner utilizes both water and diesel. A special chamber is made over the burner, from the corner of which passes a small pipe which is used for pouring drops of water over the plate. The water is poured onto it drop by drop and it liberates more energy in the form of steam.

Two cooking stoves have been provided at the top and a third one for drying purposes at the bottom in the center. The stove emits very less smoke and also dries the food items effectively. As the entire system is made in galvanized sheet metal/aluminum, upon use it gets warm and dissipates the heat to the surrounding, keeping the room warm as well. The stove has been tested at IIIT, Manipur, Imphal where the system was found to be more efficient than available charcoal burning chulha. This is possible because the air used to burn the charcoal comes through the enclosed box, where it gets preheated. So some part of waste heat gets recovered and hence the efficiency of the cooking stove cum dryer is about 10 % more than the conventional system.

Technical details The innovation relates to hydroelectric generation and harnessing the potential energy of slow-moving water mass to pump water to a higher level. The turbinator consists of a spiral hydrofoil over a conical head and is connected to the electric generator/water pump via a general shaft where motion is transferred. The hydrofoil works on the principle of turbine dynamics, where flowing water hits the foil, it causes the spiral to shift on its axis continuously as long as the flow present. The design of hydrofoil fixed to the external sphere of the conical head allows the slow-moving water body to maximize the head from tip to bottom which reacts to the mass displacement as well as the spiral foils blocking the flow, so this gives the hydrofoil to harness maximum power from the water flow even at very low speeds. The turbinator will require a water body of 2 cusecs of flow. The turbinators are of two types: Submersible and Flooding type. Performance According to the innovator, the turbinators are smart generators that can generate 0.5 to 1 KW of electricity and pump 10 to 15 L of water per minute. Benefits The portable device (turbinator) can be installed and used in rural and interior areas where electricity is irregular/unavailable with zero/nil running cost to the user.

Technical details The 'Sarai Stove' consists of four parts. All parts are made of mild steel. Combustion chamber: It is an open-ended cylinder, with an aluminum lining from inside. There is a door on the inside, and a series of holes along the periphery at the bottom. The holes serve as air inlets. There are two clamps on the side near the top for holding the outer jacket. Fuel holder This is a mild steel cylinder with an open top and a cast iron grate at the bottom. Solid fuel in the form of wood chips, coal, charcoal, biomass briquettes, etc. are placed in the holder, which in turn is placed inside the combustion chamber through its side door. Outer jacket It is an open-ended cylinder that fits on the top of the combustion chamber. There are two rows of holes circumscribing the cylinder near the top. Cooker with lid The cooker is a cylindrical vessel that can be inserted into the outer jacket, leaving an annular space of just about 2.5-3 mm between the walls of the two. It has a wide rim at the top, which seals up the annular space. The lid fits snugly into the open top of the cooker. To operate the stove, the fuel holder loaded with fuel is inserted into the combustion chamber. The outer jacket is fitted on to the chamber, and the cooker is inserted into it. About 200 ml of water is poured into the cooker and the cooking vessels are stacked in it, one on top of the other. The lid is closed and the fire is started. The air required for combustion of the fuel enters from the holes at the bottom of the combustion chamber and is sucked into the fuel stack through the grate at the bottom of the fuel holder. The hot gases and flames emitted by the fire pass through the annular space between the outer jacket and the cooker, and come out through the holes near the top of the outer jacket. The heat is conducted into the cooker through its bottom and walls and converts the water inside into the steam. The cooker fills up with steam and generates a sufficiently high temperature within the cooker to cook the food. Because of the fuel placed in the burner is limited, the stove extinguishes itself after a certain time. The food inside the vessel remains hot after the fire goes out due to the double jacket surrounding it. For frying or bread making, the outer jacket can be detached from the combustion chamber and the chamber can be used as a portable single pot stove. Performance The stove can be operated on any solid biomass fuel. Only 100 g of the charcoal is required to prepare food for 4-5 persons. The stove design is optimized for good combustion efficiency hence, cooking takes place in a smokeless environment. The outer jacket also can be used with a gas or kerosene stove, to increase fuel efficiency. Benefits The stove has higher fuel efficiency and it is smokeless.

It can use coconut shell or wood as fuel. Innovator has improvised the stove by incorporating a secondary combustion chamber for burning the un-burnt biomass and hydrocarbons coming out with the smokes/exhaust. As a result, the thermal efficiency of the stove has improved while the pollution has reduced. There are two layers of ceramic materials having a 2-inch gap between them. The outer wall also has two openings for air inlet and the inner wall also has secondary holes that facilitate the burning of smoke that enhances the fuel efficiency. The air enters through the outer wall gets heated in the annular chamber, and it enters through the holes through the combustion chamber and hence provides full combustion. To meet their cooking energy needs, large numbers of households in the country's poorer, rural areas used traditional chulha/ stoves which consume used firewood and other biomass as fuel. The fuel efficiency of this chulha is very very low and it creates indoor pollution and burning solid fuels indoors results in high levels of toxic pollutants, a major risk factor for lung cancer, and cardiovascular and respiratory disease.

It is centrally placed at the left half of the stove. Boiler: Boiler is a ring-shaped chamber and is located right above the burner with its inner wall surrounding the air space above the burner. The boiler is equipped with a number of copper tubes, which stick into the container space from the inner brass wall of the boiler. The inside ends of copper tubes are closed water tight and outer ends are opened. This arrangement ensures better and uniform heat transmission into the water body kept in the boiler. Also, the top surface of the boiler is tapered to confirm with the flow pattern of the flame facilitating direct contact with it. Water storage vessel: Conical shape 9 cm high tapering from 8 cm to 4 cm made of steel. This is connected to the boiler bottom through the copper tube with a regulator fixed in between. This is placed at the centre of the stove. Steam cooking vessel: A 21 cm diameter, 11.5 cm high vessel made of steel centrally placed at the right half of the stove.

Insulating materials: The boiler is insulated by asbestos sheets. The steam outlet tube is insulated by asbestos rope. The cooking vessel is insulated by 2 cm thick layer of glass wool surrounding it. Working: The fuel gas from the burner burns off as it goes upward. As the flame reaches the bottom surface of the vessel above almost complete combustion of the fuel would takes place. The extra heat generated by better and usual heat loss (radiation, convection) would be absorbed by the boiler and steam is produced from it. The steam formed at the top of the boiler is then taken to the cooking vessel using insulated copper tubes. In this vessel, steam-based cooking can be done. i.e., to make IDLIES it would take only 6 to 8 minutes. Water supply to the boiler can be regulated depending on cooking requirements. Thus along with regular cooking steam-based cooking can also be done without using extra fuel. Arrangements for tapping boiled water for making TEA, COFFEE, etc. can also be made.

The thermal efficiency, cooking power, color of the flame, soot on the vessel etc. have been adequately taken care of. Even the sound, while using the stove, has been reduced. Pressure type kerosene stove: The severe shortage of petrol based liquid fuels is no new in India. It is found that domestic and commercial stoves are run only on kerosene. There are two types of kerosene stoves - the wick & pressure or pump types. The former one is low in power and slow to cook & the latter one gives loud noise in operation. It is evident that to enhance efficiency of domestic stoves, efforts should be concentrated to minimize the two major losses - plus gas and radiation/convection. From test results it is estimated that such a simple, yet effective, measure can reduce oil-consumption. This is the basis of designing the improved version of pressure-stove in the proposed industrial unit. The conceptual diagram of the product newly conceived is shown in appendix III. For ease of understanding, the figure is shown with the oil tank removed, so that the concept of furnace cover can be fully demonstrated. Due to cost considerations ultimately the inner surface of the covers was not made shiny. Arranging to rivet the two plates together and then drilling could fabricate the covers. This pressure type kerosene stove widely used in India and consuming 10 million tones of oil annually on a conservative estimate. The market for Pressure Stove could be greatly increased by developing a safety type unit and also units employing non - pressure type of mechanism. This entrepreneurial - innovative project has effected potential saving of 50% or more, i.e. 5 million tones of kerosene annually, but is yet to take off due to financial constraints & other entrepreneurial stumbling blocks prevalent in the country.",,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,7.0,,,,,clean cooking,environment friendly,stove,kerosene stove,,22.56263,88.36304,,,,,,,,,,India,rb_asia_pacific,,product

Firewood being a non-renewable source of energy, she thought of developing some manner of using this heat energy that is being wasted. Her resolution was strengthened by the fact that it is also very difficult to procure enough supplies of firewood, especially for the poor. This formed a perfect backdrop for the birth of the idea and she designed this stove, which would help save fuel as well as prevent wastage of heat. In the process of developing her innovation, she encountered some difficulties. She was not able to get the cooperation from the mechanics at the workshop when she sought their help for building her stove and she had to run around a lot to get things done. The Innovator has installed this modified stove unit in her kitchen along with five meters of plumbing to connect the hot water to the tank in an adjacent room to work as a (non-electric) geyser and has been using it successfully for the last three years. Word has spread regarding her innovation. This is a multipurpose energy-efficient utility stove which captures the wasted radiated heat in a wood-fired stove to simultaneously cook as well as heat water in a tall drum to a temperature of 80 degrees. The unit works on the principle that cold water flows down and hot water rises up. The arrangement consists of a stainless steel enclosure-envelope on three sides of a wood-fired stove and two pipes that are connected to the stove. These pipes are connected to the pipes from the boiler in the bathroom. Coldwater comes in from the bottom inlet pipe, gets heated and passes out of the hot water pipes to go and fill a stainless steel hot water container. A separate tap is attached to the hot water pipe on the side of the oven to collect mugs of hot water for making tea, coffee. While food gets cooked in the oven, the cold water flows in, gets heated and fills in from the top into the tall drum placed on a stool behind the stove. In two hours up to 150 liters of hot water at 80-degree centigrade is made available in the drum. The entire unit is portable and can be set up anywhere. NIF has sanctioned Jyothi Ravishankar a sum of Rs.5, 625 from the Micro Venture Innovation Fund for making a prototype to conduct market survey of the Stove cum Water Heater. Benefits The novelty of the device lies in the fact that with the same source of heat two functions can be performed simultaneously- for example, cooking and heating water in the boiler. There is efficient energy utilization of burnt wooden fuel-stock. The cost is around Rs. 1000 because the water chamber of the stove is made of stainless steel to prevent rusting.
