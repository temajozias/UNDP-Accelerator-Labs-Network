# UNDP Accelerator Labs Network

UNDP Accelerator Labs Network  Help us to showcase the value of grassroots innovation! We need easy to understand, yet powerful visualizations of the energy solutions we discovered that help us advocate for a more sustainable future. Be bold and creative.

## Summary of Findings

- `India` has the highest number of solutions
- `Panama` is the second best solutions provider
- `Argentina` is the third best solutions provider
- `Pacific` is the fourth best solutions provider
- `Ecuador` is the fifth best solutions provider


- `rb_africa` has the highest number of solutions
- `rb_latin_america` is the second best solutions provider
- `rb_asia_pacific` is the third best solutions provider


- The most produced `energy_source` is `Household application` and this solution is more prevalent in the regional bureau `rb_asia_pacific`, then `rb_africa` and `rb_latin_america`. It can be relative to the proverty level, which is high in these locations.
- The second most produced `energy_source` is `Solar` and more prevalent in  the regional bureau `rb_latin_america` then `rb_asia_pacific`, `rb_africa` and `rb_arab_states`. It can be relative to the poor developpement of other energy sources in the locations of the first three, and the desert with his high level of solar reception in the locations of the `rb_arab_states`.
- The third most produced `energy_source` is `Thermal` and more prevalent in  the regional bureau `rb_africa`, `rb_latin_america` and `rb_asia_pacific`.
- Overall energy sources, the more prevalent locations are `rb_africa`, `rb_latin_america` and `rb_asia_pacific`, certainly because of the development level which is low in these locations. That said, we understand why there are not so many solutions in `rb_europe_cis` and `rb_arab_states`.



- The most represented thematic is `Energy` (either `clean energy`, `solar energy`, `renewable energy`, `alternative energy`, `affordable energy`, `sustainable energy`)
- The second most represented thematic is `environment friendly`
- The third is `climate change`



- The most represented SDG is `Affordable and Clean Energy`
- The second is `Sustainable Cities and Communities`
- The third is `Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure`


- More `clean_cooking` solutions are produced in `rb_asia_pacific`, `rb_africa` and `rb_latin_america`
- Many solutions are replicable elsewhere, and most of solutions are coming from `rb_africa` and `rb_latin_america`.
- Many solutions have been already ordered, most from `rb_africa`.



- Most of the solutions are `open_source` representing about `71.4%` overall.
- Most `open_source` solutions are from `rb_africa` and `rb_latin_america`.
- Most of the solutions are `product` (ready to scale) representing about `64.2%` overall.
- Most `product` solutions are from `rb_africa`, `rb_asia_pacific` and `rb_latin_america`.



- Many coutries have more `open_source` solutions than `intellectual_property` solutions, such as `Argentina`, `Guinea`, `Cameroon`, `Ethiopia` and `Syria`.
- Many coutries have more `product` solutions (ready to scale) than `prototype` solutions, such as `India`, `Cameroon`, `Pacific`, `Panama`, `Ecuador`, `Burkina Faso` and `Ethiopia`.
- Many product solutions have a TRL of 9 : Actual system proven in operational. They are ready to be scaled.
- Many prototype solutions have a TRL of 7 : System prototype demonstration in operational environment. 



- `rb_latin_america` has more `prototype` `open_source` solutions than `product` `open_source` solutions.
- `rb_asia_pacific` has more `prototype` `open_source` solutions than `product` `open_source` solutions.
- `rb_africa` has more `product` `open_source` solutions than `prototype` `open_source` solutions.



- Countries with more `prototype` `open_source` solutions than `product` `open_source` solutions: `Argentina`, `Eswatini`.
- Countries with more `product` `open_source` solutions than `prototype` `open_source` solutions: `Cameroon`, `Ecuador`, `Ethiopia`, `Burkina Faso`, `Pacific` and `Syria`.




Among the 359 solutions, there are 59 solutions with exact production cost.

The bin range is $300. 

It means that about 28 solutions need at most $300 for implementation or scalin
